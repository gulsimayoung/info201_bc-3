Potential Data Sets: 
SPD Use of Force data set from 2017 until now
SPD is well-known for their history of use-of-force violations, particularly against Black people 
With this dataset we could explore geographically where force is most commonly used and against which races force is most commonly used 
There are also different levels of force, so we could explore where in the city different levels are more common

Also hereâ€™s an article about the use of force reports which seem to come out every year, could be helpful for understanding the data: https://sccinsight.com/2018/02/02/understanding-spd-use-force-report/

SPD Call Data
With this data set we could explore where calls to police are coming from 
We could potentially work with this data in conjunction with income levels and demographics of the precincts/sectors where the calls were made

Crime and Incarceration Rates in the US 
With this data set we could ask questions about what effect mass incarceration has had on crime rates, and if incarceration is effective at all
