# Project Proposal

## Potential Data Sets: <br> 
* [SPD Use of Force (from 2017 until now)](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Use-Of-Force/ppi5-g2bj): <br> 
  SPD is well-known for their history of use-of-force violations, particularly against Black people 
  With this dataset we could explore geographically where force is most commonly used and against which races force is most commonly used 
  There are also different levels of force, so we could explore where in the city different levels are more common <br>

  Also, [hereâ€™s an article](https://sccinsight.com/2018/02/02/understanding-spd-use-force-report/) about the use of force reports which seem to come out every year,   could be helpful for understanding the data.

* [SPD Call Data](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Call-Data/33kz-ixgy):  <br> 
  With this data set we could explore where calls to police are coming from 
  We could potentially work with this data in conjunction with income levels and demographics of the precincts/sectors where the calls were made 

* [Crime and Incarceration Rates in the US](https://www.kaggle.com/christophercorrea/prisoners-and-crime-in-united-states): <br> 
  With this data set we could ask questions about what effect mass incarceration has had on crime rates, and if incarceration is effective at all <br>

* [Seattle Demographics and Income](https://www.census.gov/data/academy/data-gems/2019/access-race-data.html) <br>




## Domain of Interest: <br> 
  * Why are you interested in this field/domain? <br>
  * What other examples of data driven projects have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)? <br>
  [Calls for Service Dashboard](http://www.seattle.gov/police/information-and-data/calls-for-service-dashboard) <br>
  This project highlights the various calls for service, both criminal and non-criminal. It presents a visual layout of the different call groups, and the number of   calls in 2020 for each, breaking them down into both general and specific groups. There is also a map of the Seattle area, representing 2020 call volume by beat     (the area and time an officer is on patrol). Lastly, this study shares a graph of call volume by both week/day and month. <br>
  
  [Call Data | City of Seattle](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Call-Data/33kz-ixgy) <br>
  This is an ongoing collection of call data, logging police response activity. Calls are from both community members and officers who have logged calls. Each call
  is located to the "beat" level, and over 95% of calls are listed in this data set. It was created in April of 2018, and is refreshed daily. There are roughly 4.5
  million rows. <br>
  
  [Changes in Police Calls for Service During the Early Months of the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7337826/) <br>
  This study highlights the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on police call statistics during the early months of the pandemic in the United States. It dives 
  into the types of calls that became more and less frequent, and overall call data for many major cities, including Seattle. We included this study because as we 
  work to dissect, connect, and analyze data, it will be important that we search for and stay aware of confounding variables and contributing factors like this.
  
  
  * What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)? <br>

## Finding Data: <br>  
  * Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)? <br>
  * How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about? <br>
  * How many observations (rows) are in your data? <br>
  * How many features (columns) are in the data? <br>
  * What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset? <br>
